2. Allies.
   =======
   The Allies, the sneaky, the cheap, the guys with the map advantages :)
   The Allies ( Germany, France and England ) although they don't have the
   tank power, they got the advantage of surprise. With their fast light
   tanks for quick attacks (Recon bikes), their Gaps, Gps Satellite,
   Chronosphere and Strong Navy, and cool infantry they can stand their
   ground.

2.1 Infantry.  NOTE: None of the infantry has any armor. Doh!
    =========
    Rifle Soldier.  Cost: 100
    --------------
    Weapon   : M1 Carbine       Damage      : 15
    Strength : 50               Weapon Range: 3
    Sight    : 4                Weapon Speed: 100
    Speed    : 4                Techlevel   : 1

    The Rifle Soldier is very cheap, good in groups. Best infantry against
    Rocket soldiers. If you have 5 Rifle soldiers and there is a flamer
    in front of you Don't send them all at the flamer , move them back and
    send one at a time. They are ok for building's and are the allies main
    infantry unit defense against all other infantry. Use with tank rushes to
    take out Rocket soldiers and as tank fire diversion.

    Rocket Soldier. Cost: 300
    ---------------
    Weapon  : Dragon     Damage      : 30
    Strength: 25         Weapon Range: 5
    Sight   : 4          Weapon Speed: 50
    Speed   : 3          Techlevel   : 1

    The Rocket soldiers are amazing for Air Defense, against the Soviets
    weak Migs and Yak's. Spread these units out through your base. Also very
    good for tanks. Can hit walls, guard them though any infantry can take
    them out easily, especially Soviet dogs. They are slow, useful to guard
    Harvesters against Air Assaults and with an APC or two they'll be fine.
    Rocket soldiers also outrange a lot of units and buildings like the flame
    turret and Pillboxes. Carry them around in APC's to get them somewhere
    quick.

    Engineer. Cost: 500
    ---------
    Strength: 25
    Sight   : 4
    Speed   : 4

    I used to think these guys were pretty useless, until i saw how well they
    can repair your buildings. Yes an engineer can repair your building back
    to FULL strength. They can still take over an enemy building, but only if
    it's in the red. If they infiltrate a Building that is not in red they
    will damage the building. They are pretty fast, but weak and expensive.
    I think four is the max needed to take over a building in full health,
    good idea to send in a 5th to repair the enemies captured building. Keep
    a few around your base to repair buildings under siege.

    Tanya. Cost: 1200  Shake it baby!
    ------
    Weapon  : Double Colt45 , C4 Charge   Damage      : 50 x2
    Strength: 100                         Weapon Range: 5.75
    Sight   : 6                           Speed       : 5

    Need an Allied Tech Center. New and improved Commando Tanya. She's fast
    with a big sight view. Only thing she is good for is infantry and
    buildings, don't even bother with anything else. Here C4 explosion takes
    down any building in one shot, and the best part is after the building has
    exploded no infantry will come running out, so u could blow up lots of
    buildings without any interference. Infantry have no chance against her
    she reloads too quickly and can take out MANY infantry before dying. Use
    with tanks rushes to take out Tesla's and such. Quick way to blow up
    bridges using her C4 charge. Try sending her in early, because Soviet
    players will take a while to build Tesla's. Don't worry about the flame
    turrets she can run right through them. This has happened many a time to
    me. If you make her try C4 a building with 6 flame turrets around it the
    chances are that she'll only die afterwards. Another thing is as she's
    built you can hear here laugh can be a psychological scare to someone,but
    is also a giveaway. She has a HUGE range.

    Spy. Cost: 500
    ----
    Strength: 25            Techlevel : 6
    Sight   : 5             Speed     : 4

    Need a comm center to build. Try sending the spies in early before they
    enemy builds dogs or a comm center. The spies look like your enemies
    rifle infantry. They can only be detected by dogs or a manual attack.
    Infiltration is the game, here's a short list of each building.
    Power plant     : See what shape enemies power is in, green is good, brown
                      is bad and red is the worst.
    Barracks        : See what infantry the enemy is building (pretty useless)
    War Factory     : See what vehicle the enemy is building , only slightly
                      useful
    Construction yard: See what building he is constructing. Useful to see if
                      he's got a Tesla on hold or waiting to place it when
                      you attack.
    Radar           : Can see how many units, buildings hes got. Can also read
                      allies messages to each other. (New!) You can see
                      everywhere the enemy has scouted and everywhere he
                      scouts afterwards.
    Refinery &amp; silo : Can see how much money the enemy has, this is quite
                      useful.
    Airfield        : See what air unit he is building or has built.
    Sub pen         : Get a sonar pulse. Sonar pulse charges every 10 minutes,
                      and reveals all subs for a short period of time.

    The only way he can get rid of your spy is by selling the building your
    spy is in.

    Thief. Cost: 500
    ------
    Strength: 25          Speed    : 4
    Sight   : 5           Techlevel: 15

    Need an Allied Tech center. This unit is simple, he infiltrates an enemy
    Refinery or silo and steals half the money, which is then transferred to
    you. Try getting them in early very devastating, disable the enemies money
    (New!)
    Always go for silo's though becuase they hold more money than the
    refineries.

    Medic.  Cost: 800
    ------
    Weapon  : Heal         Speed : 4
    Strength: 80           Damage: -50
    Sight   : 3            Range : 1.83

    The medic automatically heals all infantry within range. Not extremely
    useful, maybe for Tanya. Heals 50 hitpoints at a time. Use for units
    defending the base, sort of like recycling. Cannot heal himself. (New!)
    Now that i know how to use this unit i find him Much more useful, build
    two medics so that they can heal each other. Put them on Guard using G
    and they will run around looking for damaged units, try it, its cool.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2.2 Vehicles.
    =========
    Allies have a wide selection of vehicles early in the game. Ranger for
    scouting, mobile artillery for infantry, and tanks against tanks.

    Light tank. Cost :700
    -----------
    Weapon  : 75mm         Damage      : 25
    Strength: 300          Weapon Range: 4
    Armor   : heavy        Weapon Speed: 40
    Speed   : 10           Techlevel   : 4
    Sight   : 4

    The light tanks are the fastest tanks in the game. They only do 5 less
    damage then the medium tank and have less hitpoints. They build fast and
    are cheaper (sometimes the size of an army is better than strength). Less
    range but faster fire rate. They are actually very similar to the recon
    bikes, they are fast and good for quick harvester attacking. Speed is
    basically their best weapon, they are not to good at fighting with other
    tanks so rush them into the enemy's base, attack a few buildings and get
    out, DO NOT try fighting with the Soviet tanks unless there are very few.
    Same as harvestor attacks send your lights on harvestor raids and then
    get them back to your base before the Soviets can get thier slow tanks
    there.

    Medium tank. Cost :800
    ------------
    Weapon  : 90mm            Damage      : 30
    Strength: 400             Weapon range: 4.75
    Sight   : 5               Armor       : Heavy
    Speed   : 9               Techlevel   : 6

    Fast and strong tank the best in the Allies arsenal. Cheaper than the
    Soviet tanks, in turn means more has to be built. Best for heavy armor
    armored vehicles, then wood(buildings) and then light. Guard the heavy
    tanks with Rifle infantry against other infantry, or u can just try the
    old squish'em. Note: Tank's have become a big part of Red Alert, build
    lots of em. All Allied tanks are pretty fast take advantage of that.

    Ranger. Cost :600
    -------
    Weapon  : M60mg        Damage      : 15
    Strength: 150          Weapon range: 4
    Sight   : 6            Armor       : light
    Speed   : 12           Techlevel   : 3

    This is basically a scouting unit. Same weapon as Rifle soldier so it is
    fairly good against infantry, fast and wide sight. Bit expensive for what
    they are, i'd rather use an APC.

    Ore truck. Cost :1400
    ----------
    Strength: 600        Armor    : light
    Sight   : 4          Techlevel: 1
    Speed   : 6

    Need a Weapons factory and Refinery. Ore trucks are your primary source
    of income, you can have 2-3 to one refinery because they now unload much
    quicker. They are now faster and stronger. They can also self heal
    themselves back to half health. And they just over all seem to last
    longer, but they still have to be guarded. Infantry can now be used since
    the gold has no effect on them. 3-5 Rocket soldiers for Mig attacks and
    2 APC's for infantry should do fine. Note: they are not to bright and seem
    to wonder a lot, so keep an eye on them. If you see a Gem patch don't be
    lazy they are worth much more and don't regrow. Remember if you loose your
    harvester then you won't have an income and if you loose your income you
    might have already lost. Repair them often becuase they will just be easy
    pickings at half power.

    Mobile Artillery. Cost :600
    -----------------
    Weapon   : 155mm       Damage      : 150
    Strength : 75          Weapon range: 6
    Sight    : 5           Weapon speed: 12
    Speed    : 6           Armor       : light
    Techlevel: 8

    The arty is now faster and can do some real damage, between its long range
    and deadly cannon, any building or infantry unit will suffer. The allies
    haven't got much mass anti-infantry units in the field, the Soviets got
    the Flamers, grenadiers and the V2 Rocket launcher, this is the best we
    got. They are also very good for buildings, make a good chronoshift
    passenger. Not good at all for armor. Can be useful early in the game
    against infantry attacks.

    A-V Mine layer. Cost :800
    ---------------
    Weapon  : Anti-vehicle mine   Ammo     : 5
    Strength:100                  Damage   : 1200
    Sight   : 5                   Techlevel: 3
    Speed   : 9

    Need a Weapons Factory and a Service depot. Use the mine layers when your
    not doing much. Place the mines infront off bridges, on bridges, entrances
    to your base to disable the Soviet tank rushes a bit. Best of all put them
    in your enemies ore fields, that should get them going. You can reload
    another 5 mines by going onto the service depot. Mine layers have little
    hitpoints and if attacked while laying a mine, the mine will explode
    leaving them with little or no health. Infantry cannot set them off.

    Mobile Construction Vehicle. Cost :2500
    ----------------------------
    Strength: 600        Speed    : 6
    Sight   : 4          Techlevel: 15

    Need a weapons factory and Service depot. MCV is the vehicle that turns
    into your construction yard. Use them to set up multiple bases on the new
    large maps, near some ore. Beware if your enemies spot your MCV, they will
    probably send some air units in, or they might just attack it from the
    ground. So try send some units with, have a Gap generator ready to place
    down to avoid the air attack, then start placing some turrets. Note: You
    will be able to Build twice as fast with two cons yards. Cheap for 2500.

    Radar Jammer. Cost :600
    -------------
    Strength: 110         Range    : 15
    Sight   : 7           Armor    : light
    Speed   : 9           Techlevel: 15

    Need a Weapons factory and Comm center to build. The Radar jammer
    basically makes the enemies mini map go fuzzy white color and not
    function when you get in range of the dome. I havnt found very much use
    for this unit. You could use it with tanks rushes to confuse the enemy.
    The radar jammer can't be seen on the enemies radar neither.

    Mobile Gap Generator. Cost :600
    ---------------------
    Strength: 110          Armor    : light
    Sight   : 4            Techlevel: 15
    Speed   : 9

    Need a Weapons factory and Allied Tech center. This is similar to the Gap
    generator, except produces a smaller gap. Basically this generates a small
    black gap on the enemies map and he can't see anything there. This unit is
    good for helping Soviet team mates, its's got quite a wide gap. Also good
    if you want to surprise them enemy with some weird attack, like put a
    Tanya under the gap or just send one in so the enemy thinks you are
    planing an attack. (New!) Use with your tank rushes 2-3 of them so the
    enemy cant see how many tanks you have or they think you got more than you
    have.

    APC. Cost :800
    ----
    Weapon  : M60mg       Armor    : heavy
    Strength: 200         Passengers: 5
    Sight   : 5           Techlevel : 5
    Speed   : 14

    Need a tent and Weapons factory to build. Ahh the good old APC, this unit
    is fast and tough. Ever wonder how you gonna carry all the Allies sneaky
    new infantry (Thief's, spies, Tanyas) well this is the answer. Pack some
    Tanya's into an APC run the APC into the enemies base and start blowing
    stuff up. The APC's are fast enough to get past the tesla's and Tanya's
    can move past the flame turrets. Send in two or three APC's and put some
    Rifle soldiers in the extra ones for fodder. APC are also good for
    infantry and can last long. Very good for scouting as well. Hey they can
    even still squish well :) . Also can be used with tanks if you put some
    Rocket soldiers in them.

2.3 Buildings.
    ==========
    Construction Yard. Cost :2500
    ------------------
    Strength: 800          Armor   : Wood
    Sight   : 5            Power   : 0

    Need this building to build all other buildings, get one free at the
    beginning if you play with bases on, but most people do. Its pretty strong
    and doesn't lose a lot of hitpoints against the nuke. Uses no power so
    don't even think of selling it if your low on power to get power. Lose
    this and you wont be able to build anything. Protect it!!

    Power plant. Cost: 300
    ------------
    Strength: 400      Armor    : wood
    Sight   : 4        Techlevel: 1
    Power   : 100

    Sole purpose to produce power. Quite weak and very small. Build this
    immediately after Consyard.

    Ore refinery. Cost :2000
    -------------
    Strength: 900     Armor    : wood
    Sight   : 6       Storage  : 2000
    Power   : -30     Techlevel: 1

    Need power plant to build. Set up 2 or 3 of these nearest to the ore
    fields, try leave some space around the refinery to make less traffic.
    Guard the refineries, lose these you want be getting any money.

    Advanced Power plant. Cost :500
    ---------------------
    Strength: 600         Armor    : wood
    Sight   : 4           Techlevel: 8
    Power   : 200

    Need a power plant to build. Bigger, less expensive than 2 power plants
    for the same amount of power. One Advanced power plant is easier to kill
    than two small power plants so balance the power plants out. DO NOT put
    power plants together its the perfect target for nukes.

    Tent. Cost :300
    -----
    Strength: 800         Armor    : wood
    Sight   : 5           Techlevel: 1
    Power   : -20

    Need power plant. Tent is the where you produce all your infantry. They
    are cheap and strong so build 2 or more to pump out your infantry faster.
    At the beginning people like to send in infantry attacks or scouts, so be
    sure to place the tent straight after your first power plant.

    Naval Yard. Cost :650
    -----------
    Strength: 1000        Armor    : light
    Sight   : 4           Techlevel: 3
    Power   : -50

    Need power plant. To be built the sea must be within 8 squares, which is
    pretty close. Produces all navy units. Building is strong with decent
    armor. Build up a navy early to surprise the enemy.

    Pill box. Cost :400
    ---------
    Weapon  :Vulcan       Damage      : 40
    Strength: 400         Weapon Range: 5
    Sight   : 4
    Power   : -10

    Need a tent to build. Very good anti-infantry weapon, place this one
    nearer to the middle and back of your base, because it is weaker than the
    Cammo pillbox. Also good for light armored vehicles. Soviets like to drop
    their paratroopers ever so often so be prepared. I prefer the cammo
    pillbox for 200 extra you get 200+ hitpoints and its difficult to see,
    plus the cammo has a larger sight range. But you don't need a strong
    pillbox at the back of your base since the paratroopers are the only ones
    that normally get there.

    Camouflaged pillbox. Cost :600
    --------------------
    Weapon  : Vulcan       Armor       : wood
    Strength: 600          Techlevel   : 3
    Sight   : 5            Damage      : 40
    Power   : -10          Weapon Range: 5

    Same as pill box, but it's well camouflaged with the terrain, and 200 more
    hitpoints. Place the cammo box on the outside of your base because they
    are stronger and are probably gonna get pounded on by tanks.

    Turret. Cost: 600
    -------
    Weapon  : Turret gun      Armor       : heavy
    Strength: 400             Damage      : 40
    Sight   : 6               Weapon range: 6
    Power   : -40             Weapon speed: 40

    Need tent to build. Turrets are the best base defense against tanks we
    got. Build them and lots of them. 4-6 do well at each entrance, with one
    or two pillboxes. Unfortunately you can build walls near them because
    they'll shot em down, but with a lot of tanks and some rocket soldiers you
    should be safe. They also use up more power than people think, same as the
    radar dome.

    War factory. Cost :2000
    ------------
    Strength: 1000        Armor    : light
    Sight   : 4           Techlevel: 3
    Power   : -30

    Need a Refinery to build. You need to build 2 or more early to start
    pumping out those tanks and harvestors. The War factory is strong, but
    take a bit long to build. Produces all the vehicles in the game.

    Radar dome. Cost :1000
    -----------
    Strength: 1000      Armor    : wood
    Sight   : 10        Techlevel: 3
    Power   : -40

    Need a refinery to build. Personally i can't play to well without this
    building. It open up a link with your satellite and shows you the map,
    the areas you have scouted and the areas you havnt is plain black. Also
    shows everybody else playing, with their according colors. Push U to
    toggle the map modes.

    Ore Silo. Cost :150
    ---------
    Strength: 300      Armor    : wood
    Sight   : 4        Techlevel: 1
    Power   : -10      Storage  : 1500

    Need refinery. Stores an extra 1500 ore. Build em because when your
    fighting you always seem to forget about your money and if you don't have
    extra space all the money you mine will go to waste. Silo's are cheap and
    can be used to space out your buildings a bit more.

    Service Depot. Cost :1200
    --------------
    Strength: 800        Armor    : wood
    Sight   : 5          Techlevel: 3
    Power   : -30

    Need a weapons factory. Repair all vehicles for 20% of the cost. Reload
    mines for mine layers. Can repair multiple vehicles.

    Allied Tech center. Cost :1500
    -------------------
    Strength: 400       Armor    : wood
    Sight   : 10        Techlevel: 7
    Power   : -200

    Need a weapons factory and a Radar dome. This building charges your GPS
    satellite for 8 minutes, then launches this nuke like thing into the air,
    then you can see the whole map. It also lets you build advanced buildings.
    Its weak and uses a lot of power, so put it in the back of your base,
    because if you loose this building them you loose your whole map, EVEN the
    areas you have scouted Not nice. It works even if your power goes down
    though which is good, and you don't need your comm center anymore so you
    can sell it. (New!) Good idea to build two since people are now going for
    this building and they know it will disable you. Put a mobile gap there
    so they cant send a spy plane over and see it.

    Anti-Aircraft gun. Cost :600
    ------------------
    Weapons : Double ZSU-23   Damage      : 35 x2
    Strength: 400             Weapon Range: 6
    Sight   : 6               Armor       : heavy
    Power   : -40             Techlevel   : 5

    Need a Radar dome. Very good for Migs and Yaks, ok for hinds. Use quite a
    bit of power, but have good armor. Fast firing Anti-Aircraft Gun. Use
    Rocket soldiers to take out Helicopters instead. They also wont operate
    when low on power. Weak two Migs can take it down, but then two migs can
    take out most stationary base defence.

    Helipad. Cost :1500
    --------
    Strength: 800      Armor    : wood
    Sight   : 5        Techlevel: 10
    Power   : -10

    Need a radar dome. Takes long to build, get a free Longbow helicopter.
    Strong and cheap for what you get.

    Chronosphere. Cost :2800
    -------------
    Strength: 400      Armor    : wood
    Sight   : 10       Techlevel: 15
    Power   : 200

    Need Allied Tech center. Chronosphere charges a chronoshift. Uses a lot
    of power and is a weak building. Very expensive as well.

    Chronoshift
    -----------
    Charges quickly every 3 minutes, then you may select any vehicle and
    teleport them to any part of the map you can SEE, cannot be teleported to
    dark areas of them map. Every so often it may produce a Chronal vortex
    which destroys anything its sees. Get rid of it by sacrificing 5 Rifle
    soldiers. Uses: Shift an arty into someones base and start attacking their
    buildings, if a harvester is getting attacked shift it back to base, shift
    your Cruiser if you have one is probably the best thing to do since
    cruisers are so slow. You can Chronoshift your allies as well. You cannot
    shift live matter so dont try fill an APC with Tanya's and shift it
    because you will lose them. (New!) After a unit has been chronoshifted
    somewhere he will be chronoshifted back.

    Gap generator Cost. :500
    -------------------
    Strength: 1000       Armor    : wood
    Sight   : 10         Techlevel: 10
    Power   : -60

    Need an Allied Tech center. This baby rocks, it generates a big black
    area on the enemies maps, many people complain about this advantage. It
    should be placed on the edges of your bases has a large radius, cheap and
    is strong. Also disables frequent Air assaults, you can't attack what you
    can't see. Uses a lot of power, and when you are low powered they go
    offline and the enemy will be able to see your base if they have already
    scouted there, you first of all feel kinda naked + the enemy knows your
    low powered. (New!) Put Mobile Gap generators under the base Gaps to that
    the enemys Spy planes cant see through it. Make much wider Gaps than your
    actual base extends by spacing them out with Silo's then placing Gaps on
    the end, really errortates people.

    Nuke Silo. Cost :2500
    ----------
    Strength: 400      Armor    : heavy
    Sight   : 5        Techlevel: 15
    Power   : -100

    Need an Allied Tech center. Weak building, needs a lot of power, quite
    easy to take out. Holds a nuke.

    Nuke.
    -----
    Charges for 14 minutes same time as iron curtain, then select an area on
    the map to launch the nuke at. Very good for amassed power plants next to
    each other. doesn't destroy much except for power plants and very weak
    buildings. Don't even try the cons yard, unless you got a follow up attack
    Also still good for infantry and light armored vehicles, almost useless
    against tanks. </FONT>
