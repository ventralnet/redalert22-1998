The Allies store barrels full of petrol next to their buildings and units.
Shoot all the barrels you see with your airplanes. A few friendly soldiers
will drop in to assist. There's a heal-everyone crate under the church to
the west. Move your men north, and as you explore more of the map, you'll
find more barrels to shoot.<P>
     Edge a few soldiers near the unexploded bridge. Shoot the barrels by
the pillboxes to destroy them. The map  will reveal more buildings and
barrels. Blow up the other barrels. If your mission doesn't end, it's
because you've left the civilians alive. Kill them all and destroy their
buildings.

Shoot the stacks of barrels by the bridge. Build a refinery, aircraft,
power plant, and barracks. Send one man to scout up north. It's okay if he
gets killed by the jeep. Strafe the jeep with both aircraft. You'll notice
that a rocket infantryman shoots at you. Next time you're up there, strafe
him, too.<P>
     Gather all your rifle infantry and organize them into two groups of
equal size. Move south past the river crossing, and head past the ore
deposits to the west. Always keep the two groups next to each other for
defense. Inch your way one square at a time until you begin combat with the
enemy.<P>
     If a jeep appear mixed with the infantry, kill the rifle infantry
first, the jeep second, and any rocket infantry last. The enemy ore truck
will show up. Destroy it with concentrated rifle infantry fire.<P>
     With the ore truck gone, the enemy won't have enough cash reserves to
put up much of a fight. The turrets are best destroyed with concentrated
rifle fire. The Yak aircraft is good for lightly armored buildings such as
power plants and construction yards.

Kill the soldier defending the farmhouse and you'll get riflemen and
grenadiers. Send a grenadier south to blow up a line of barrels to destroy
the pillbox.<P>
     Send the men south, killing enemy infantry. Move all the units west
until you see the enemy village. Move the dogs back. Cluster the infantry
in a counter ambush formation at the pass. Send a dog into the village, and
immediately pull it back when computer starts the ambush. Kill them. The
spy escapes up north. Move all your units half way east then north through
the valley, killing the little men there. Get a grenadier to blow up all
the barrels again.<P>
     Move all units north, then into an attack formation where you can
grenade the enemy soldiers one by one until they die. Move everyone west.
blow up more barrels. Move everyone west, kill the spy. Mission complete.<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT><HR size="0">

We're going to do this one slightly differently. Move your units west until
you get to the village. Deploy the MCV along the road that stretches to the
bottom corner of the map. Build your base with a power plant first,
followed by a barracks and a refinery. You're surrounded by minerals, and
there's not much space to build buildings, but as you gather ore, the real
estate will open up.<P>
     Dogs make good border guards if you put them near your perimeter.
They'll die in the crossfire if you mix them up with your normal infantry.
Build an airstrip. Send a spy plane to an area at the very top of the
screen, aligned vertically with the first river crossing, counting from the
west. See that radar dome? You've got to take it out. When your
paratroopers are ready, drop them next to the radar dome and destroy it.<P>
     The one major strength of the Soviets is armor, so take advantage of
it by building as many heavy tanks as you can afford. Send your armor north
from the gap generator and destroy the ore truck and refinery. Stay out of
reach of the turrets, but destroy any tanks and jeeps that you see. Destroy
the weapons factory also. With unit production crippled, the enemy will lie
still. Build more armor and finish them all off.<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT><HR size="0">

<table width="100%" bgcolor="#000088">
<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="4">Soviet Mission 5</font></td></table>

Set up your base just south of the road. Get a radar dome up as soon as you
can. Scout to the north with one of your rifle infantry, and see if you can
drag the bad guys down to your turf. Pump out some tanks. Move them into
the ore fields in the north and destroy the enemy ore truck. Retreat back
to your base where your infantry can help destroy the remaining "rescue"
force.<P>
     Build three V2 launchers, and use them to take out enemy turrets. Keep
a squad of infantry close, and follow them with your tanks. Capture the
Allied construction yard, and radar dome, but don't touch the refinery or
any of the barrels.<P>
     Build six airstrips and Yaks to go with them. Use the spy plane to
reveal portions of the middle island. You're looking for the enemy
refinery. When you find it, strafe it with your Yaks to destroy it. Pick
off the units on the island one by one by air assault, or build a naval
yard to bombard them from the coast with gunboats. If you do this, you'll
need to get rid of the enemy destroyer cover with submarines. The mission
ends when every last soldier on the middle island is dead.<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT><HR size="0">

Retreat to the west, and set up your base at the far edge of the map.
Several waves of enemy rocket infantry and light tanks will attack. Counter
them with rifle infantry and five or six heavy tanks.<P>
     Send an APC into the base in the north to scout a little bit. Try to
find the refinery. Build three airstrips, and make two strafing runs on the
refinery to destroy it. Build three V2 launchers to remove enemy
fortifications, and let your tanks and your infantry deal with the other
enemy units. Capture the weapons factory and build another repair bay by
it. Repair your tanks before fighting your way east.<P>
     Cruisers will open fire on you as you reach the main island in the
east. That's okay. Concentrate on getting rid of the tanks on the island.
Move the convoy trucks through the path you cleared. Your mission ends when
you get them on the island.<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT><HR size="0">

Run for it! Move all your men down the east passageway. When you reach the
end, light the barrels and give them a taste of their own barbecue. Head
past a guarded control room to the west, and turn south. There's a pillbox
with a barrel fuse and a bunch of dogs wagging their tails. Light the
barrels to free the pups from the pound.<P>
     Split the dogs into four groups of roughly even size. Attack the
control room guards and kill them all. Move a soldier onto the control
panel plates to destroy the flame turrets.<P>
     Head west, but stop before you get a bunch of barrels. A pair of
rocket infantry will fire on the barrels, hoping to catch you in the blaze,
but they will have no such luck. Unleash the dogs on them. Continue moving
through the corridor, shooting the barrels you come across. It will widen
up into a large area full of more barrels. Stand back. Chase after the
enemy soldier and kill him. Move further towards the engineers and kill
their lone guard.<P>
     Move one engineer onto each computer terminal. Some flame turrets will
pop out of the ground and fry the Allied intelligence team. Move your
remaining engineer to the core computer terminal to end your mission.<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT><HR size="0">

This is a difficult mission. Quickly build a barracks and place it
somewhere. The enemy will disperse. If a few still linger around, a couple
rifle infantry will silence them. Construct a refinery. Build a war
factory, and pump four or five heavy tanks.
     You'll get several shipments of infantry reinforcements. Put the flame
infantry in front of the rifle infantry, and pay attention to that
manufacturer's label that says "This side towards enemy". Explore the
coastline with a transport.<P>
     Ore is going to be a problem soon. First, deal with the civilians who
keep popping flares to signal enemy transports by killing the civvies. Move
your tanks north to the large ore fields. Destroy the mine layers before
they lay mines, or you'll wish that you had later. Rush back down to your
base and defend against marauding jeeps.
     Capture the tan enemy's power station and build a barracks and
refinery up there. Roll out big numbers of heavy tanks and go after the
enemy ore trucks. If you don't kill those ore trucks, it's impossible to
win.<P>
     Use hit and run tactics to slowly deplete the enemy reserve of
vehicles. When it's time to assault the base, use the V2's to take out the
turrets and pillboxes. Your mission will end when everything is destroyed.<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT><HR size="0">

<table width="100%" bgcolor="#000088">
<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="4">Soviet Mission 9</font></td></table>

Destroy all enemy units in your base and immediately repair all your
damaged buildings. Send the ore truck south to mine gem deposits. Construct
an advanced power plant. Construct a weapons factory. Build two heavy
tanks, and an engineer.<P>
     You have to move quickly to capture an enemy base being established in
the western portion of the map. Move your tank units and your engineer to
the west. Capture the construction yard, and destroy the other buildings.
     The enemy will attempt to land on a strip of beach by your original
base, accompanied by helicopters to destroy your Tesla coil. You can build
Allied structures now, so build an AA gun by the Tesla Coil, and move your
tank units to the beach to deal with the enemy land units.<P>
     Later, an engineer laden APC will attempt to infiltrate your east
base, and a group of helicopters will go for your west base. Be on the
lookout for both of these. You can build an Allied barracks and make some
rocket infantry to counter the air threat.<P>
     With three refineries, you'll have enough income to build another
weapons factory and produce a dozen heavy tanks. Drop paratroopers into
the blackness at the west edge of the map, on the same line as your captured
 Allied construction yard. Move them north and expose the bridge. Advance
 northwards from your western base and destroy the armor. Park your two mammoth
tanks at the start of the bridge.<P>Move your group of heavy tanks east until
 you hit a clump of pine trees. There's an isthmus here. It's heavily mined, so
 advance your tanks one square at a time, shooting the square ahead of each
tank to destroy any mines that might be there. An Allied cruiser will open fire
 on the tanks. Luckily, it is so far away that it will miss, and its shots
 will destroy the Allied Force's own mines. Destroy any enemy tanks and artillery
 that attack your armor column. We want to flush the convoy truck out. Push through
 their base, without stopping to destroy their turrets. The convoy truck will panic
and leave.    That's what we want. Pursue it with your heavy tanks. The convoy
truck will eventually make it down to the bridge where we parked our mammoth tanks
and paratrooper infantry. Your mission will end five seconds later.<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT><HR size="0">

Destroy the enemy tanks with concentrated tank fire. The convoy trucks will always
 follow the closest unit. Since we want them to be safe, leave one tank behind as
a shepherd to keep the flock out of trouble. Kill rifle infantry with Yaks. Kill
rocket infantry by running over them with your tanks. Kill other vehicles by picking
 on them with concentrated tank fire. Kill AA guns with tanks. Kill turrets with
Migs. Kill ships with a combination of Migs and tanks. Destroy barrels with anything
 that is convenient. Use the spy plane to uncover your surroundings screen by screen.
 If you lose a Yak, replace it with a Mig. Two Yaks and three Migs seems to work
best on this level. Shoot the barrels by the radar dome to destroy the AA gun, then
destroy the turret from the air. Proceed west through the trees, and squish the
 rocket infantry who attempt to ambush you. Keep heading west until you see an AA
 gun on a plateau. Destroy it, and head south past the barrels. Don't stop to fire
at the turret. Once in the clearing to the south, destroy the southern AA gun. Shoot
 the barrels leading up to the central AA gun to destroy it. Three friendly engineers
will airdrop. Move them to the enemy base and capture the repair bay and the
construction yard. Destroy the ship to the south, and destroy the ship in the north
You can now repair your aircraft without fear of being shot down.Keep going west.
Destroy the barrels on the southern plateau. Use a Yak to destroy the barrels on the
 northern plateau. Continue west. Destroy the tank, squish over the rocket infantry.
 Blow a hole through the concrete barrier. If you now move your "shepherd" tank
to the far west, the convoy will follow. The mission will end when the convoy
trucks make it to the western edge of the map.<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT><HR size="0">

Make landfall slight to the north-west of your starting position. Build a refinery
and weapons factory right away. You need some heavy tanks for protection. Move
your subs east. From time to time, a cruiser will pop up in the eastern sea, and
the subs will take it out. Use your leftover transport to scout the contours of your
 island. If you don't stop, you can map out almost all of the islands despite the
massive Allied naval power. When you have four heavy tanks, send one of them east
to scout past the bridges. In the ore fields north of the bridge is a minelayer that
 you should destroy quickly. Some enemy tanks will invade your beach, but the three
 heavy tanks you left behind can contain them without any problem. To safely cross
the bridges without getting them blown to hell, you need to destroy the cruiser in
the east. This can only be done with airpower. Three Migs will kill the cruiser in
a short period of time. Build two subpens. Place one past your north shore, and the
 other one past your south. Create a wolfpack of five or six submarines in the
north, and replace any subs you lose in the south. Destroy the Allied sea power
in the channel, culminating in the destruction of their shipyard in the bay. There
 is a crate worth 2000 credits on the island in the north-west. You can drop some
paratroopers to get it if you need it, but because you need to get rid of the enemy
 navy, you might as well destroy their northern fleet with your submarine pack. Any
 enemy transports you see can be destroyed by your Migs. Use a combination of
helicopters and Migs to kill the enemy defenses around the only approachable beach
 head. The pass is heavily mined, so destroy them with helicopters by firing at
random squares. Begin destroying AA-guns, starting from the west. Three Migs will
 destroy one gun emplacement without losing aircraft. With the gun emplacements
gone, strafe the rocket infantry with your Hind helicopters, then knock out their
power stations. Destroy whatever you can from the air. Land some heavy tanks. The
 bridge may blow up. Route your units through the narrow gap east to avoid the heavy
minefield in the west pass. Destroy all units and buildings. <p>If your mission
doesn't end after you've destroyed everything in sight, you missed some of those
camouflaged pillboxes hidden behind clumps of trees.<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT><HR size="0">

Save the V2 rocket launcher at all costs. Kill the enemy vehicles with your armor,
 and destroy the turrets with the V2 launcher. Set up your base. To begin with, put
 up a weapons factory, barracks, and a repair bay. Send some of your leftover grenadiers
exploring. If one of them attracts the attention of an enemy helicopter, lead it to the
mammoth tank. Snipe at the tanks and men in the southern valley with the V2. Make some
 heavy tanks. Watch out for a chopper landing in the northern area of the base at the
same time of an enemy tank attack. Your V2 can take out the chopper, and your armor can
deal with the tanks. A thief incursion is possible at this point. Kill them with the
 mammoth. Move your tanks to the ore field just east of the base. Ambush the mine layer
as the transport delivers it. Speaking of mines, there are some mines south and to the west
 of the ore field fencing. Kill all the tanks and men on this side of the island. Five
tanks from the enemy base will attack under the shadow of a mobile gap generator. In
combat, you'll catch glimpses of the enemy units. Remember to concentrate your fire, and
you'll have no problem with this. Capture the Allied techcenter in the south-west. You'll
 get a GPS map that will show everything. Take over the allied base in this sector using
the V2's to remove gun emplacements, and using the tanks to project your might. Capture
the weapons factory and construction yard, but only after you've sunk the cruisers. Hind
choppers are best for this because they won't fly over AA on the other island. Drop some
paratroopers over the power plants to silence the AA guns. Clean up the lake of naval units.
Fill the transports with five mammoth tanks, five heavy tanks, three V2s, and two APCs loaded
 with engineers. Unload the transports on the south shore. When the beach head is secured,
use the V2's to destroy all the turrets and pillboxes. Capture the three techcenters to complete
your mission.<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT><HR size="0">

Destroy the enemy tanks. Deploy the MCV. Build a refinery, barracks, weapons factory, and repair
 bay. Train some grenadiers for base defense. Build three heavy tanks, and move your tank units
south through the ravine. Destroy the tanks and artillery, and continue until you've gone to the
 very end. Turn back. Build another refinery. Construct a subpen and make enough subs to destroy
 the Allied ships in the bay farthest south. Send a transport full of heavy tanks right up the
 bay, and destroy the radar dome and the power plants, including those on the top of the cliffs.
 Charge the enemy camp with six or seven tanks, with the aim of destroying the center radar
dome. Drop paratroopers nearby to assist. Curve your tanks northward and remove another radar
 dome. Construct a new armor column. The enemy will have run out of nearby ore, and will send
the ore trucks farther north. Destroy the trucks with some tanks, and then destroy the enemy's
 weapon factory. If you don't, you'll be up to your ears in enemy tanks and artillery. Send ten
tanks all the way north, and then west. Cross the bridge and do not stop for anything! Carry on
south through the enemy camp, past the ore fields. There is one more radar dome you need to take
 out. Do it. The chronosphere is south of those cliffs. Don't send a spy plane over there,
however, because the Allied units will try to destroy the chronosphere. Make a large group
of tanks to clean a path for your engineers, and capture the chronosphere. When I did this,
I heard EVA say, "Objective reached." A split second later, our mission failed. I don't know
if this is a bug, but there's another way to complete the mission. Instead of capturing the
chronosphere, capture the barracks to the north-west of it. Build a large group of rocket infantry
and destroy the helicopters that attack the chronosphere. Keep some tanks and infantry down there
to keep the chronosphere safe. Systematically destroy every Allied vehicle, structure, infantryman,
and ship. Regardless of your originally assigned mission, you'll see the words "Mission Successful"
when the last Allied unit is killed.<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT><HR size="0">

There are several mines in the area, so only move your units straight up and down, and not to
 the east or the west. Concentrate fire on the light tanks, artillery, then medium tanks.
 Deploy your MCV. You can check for mines in the vicinity of your base by constructing a
building, and moving the white placement markers around your perimeter. If a square within
your placement marker turns red for no apparent reason, there is a mine under that square.
<p>Group your mammoth tanks together as an air defense system. Destroy the other enemy units
 using your heavy tanks. Don't wander into the mines. Defeat the Allied vehicles that
approach from the south and from the west. Destroy the turrets guarding the bridge north
of your base with V2 rockets.<p>Get a weapons factory and repair bay quickly, and create tank
units. Scatter two or three SAM sites around your base. The Allies will make constant landings
 at certain points on your shore. Block their landing sites with heavy tanks. Scout the rest of
 your land mass with a heavy tank. Construct a subpen and build a wolfpack of submarines and a
 transport. Scout the eastern contours of your island. Some cruisers will open fire on your
base. Build an airfield in the north-eastern corner of your base as a cruiser fire sponge. Sink
 the cruiser with your wolfpack. If the cruiser is close enough to shore, V2 rockets will also
 work well. Take your wolf pack north, and destroy any other naval units, the naval yard and a
 large section of bridge. The enemy ore trucks will start coming down to your island to gather
 ore. The loss of their ore trucks will be the deathblow to the Allies, so take them out any
 way you can. For best results, place your mammoth tanks in the middle of the ore patch and wait
for the trucks. The Allies will end up sending six or seven trucks, so be prepared to wait a
 while before they run out of money. Run a large group of heavy tanks up the bridge north of
your base. Concentrate your fire on the turrets, and try to squish the rocket infantry. Take
 out the power plants. Run more heavy tanks up the western side of the island and take out
the power plants, but leave the AA guns and construction yard intact. Time to assault the base.
The enemy helicopters are painful, but the base lacks AA guns in the west part of the base.
Send an infantry squishing heavy tank up into the base from the western side. Render it invulnerable
 using the Iron Curtain, and run over the rocket infantry. If you're lucky, the cruisers will
end up destroying much of their own forces. To take out the cruisers, take out their destroyer
 escorts from land. The channel is narrow enough for several heavy tanks to get good shots at
the destroyers. Then, the cruisers can be sunk by either Migs or Hind helicopters. Put 10 heavy
 tanks and 5 V2 launchers into transports. Send them north through the east channel, and make
landfall on the strip of beach. Move the V2s north to the very edge of the cliff, and destroy
more power plants. Move west, eliminating everything you can see until the very last Allied unit
and finally, the time you have been waiting for. MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!
