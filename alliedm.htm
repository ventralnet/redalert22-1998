Shoot the infantry who charge your position. When Tanya makes an airdrop,
kill all the infantry with her that you can. Set a C4 charge on one of the
power plants. If you shoot the infantry surrounding the tech center,
Einstein will emerge. Direct him to the helicopter and you're outta here.

Move packs of infantry to the south, south west, and north-west of your
construction yard to defend against enemy troops. You get reinforcements
each time you construct a major building. The kind of base you build is
important, because you have to use the base you build now in a future
mission. Build two pillboxes up by the ore field in the north, and another
two pillboxes in the south and west of your base.<P>
     Group your vehicles together and follow the road south. Use
concentrated fire in killing the opposition, and kill the grenadiers first.
You'll find the enemy ore truck in the south west corner. If you destroy
it, the enemy won't have enough money to make any more reinforcements.
     Move your pack of Jeeps into the enemy base. Kill the grenadiers,
infantry, and dogs then get back on the road and continue your trek north
to kill the units guarding the pass. Afterwards, go back to the enemy base
and destroy the buildings. Your convoy will automatically arrive when all
of the opposition is killed or destroyed.

Immediately tell the medic being shot to move north. Send Tanya down to
kill the enemy soldier attacking him, then shoot any soldiers trying to
kill Tanya. Tanya will never fire a weapon in defense of herself, but as
long as you keep squeezing her trigger finger, she'll keep firing. Heal her
with the medic if she's damaged.<P>
     Move to the west, and curve south, shooting the enemy along the way.
If you can land an artillery shell on the transport that drops off the
troops, you can wipe them out en masse. Keep trekking southwards until you
get to the enemy base. Let Tanya pick off the soldiers one by one as your
artillery pounds the flame turret. This base here is not your objective, so
you just want to kill all the enemy infantry.<P>
     Move east around the base, and swing northwards. Shoot any barrels you
see. A V2 rocket launcher will take a pot-shot at you, but probably miss.
Shoot the barrels nearby to take it out.<P>
     Take out the first bridge. There are enemy soldiers hiding behind the
trees, so proceed carefully. Shoot the barrels by the bridge at the top of
the screen and you'll destroy it. If Tanya gets herself stuck on an island,
your artillery unit can destroy any bridges that remain.

This mission takes place on the same map as your second mission, and you'll
start out with whatever units and structures you had leftover from that
mission.<P>
     Constructing a radar dome will give you a better picture of what's
going on. Put up a weapons factory. You're going to churn out at least a
dozen light tanks. There's a pass up north you should mine heavily. The
enemy has air support. If you place rocket infantry to the north-west of
the buildings they are strafing,  you'll take them down.
     Send you horde of light tanks to the top of the screen where the
Soviet's are gather ore. If you can take out the ore truck with shots fired
from below the plateau, do so. If not, you'll have to swing around the
corner, past their base and get right into their ore deposit to take out
that ore truck. If you don't kill this ore truck, the Soviets will keep
throwing their armor at you.<P>
     You've got a dozen tanks in this field of ore. After the ore truck is
dead, shoot at the attacking tanks using the focused fire tactic, and
squish the infantrymen. Then destroy the refinery, and the flame turrets.
Send your jeeps up to the enemy base to help kill the infantry.
Enemy resistance from this point on is minimal, and you won't have
difficulty mopping up.
<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT>
<hr size="0"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000088">
<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="4">Allied Mission 5</font></td></table>
To get the spy past the guard dogs, you need patience. The patrols will
change position every so often, and you'll need to observe them for a
minute before you make your move. Get the spy into the weapons factory, and
you'll hijack a truck. The truck will drop you off by the prison compound.
     Get the spy into the prison to release Tanya. Tanya has to take out
all the SAM sites before her rescue chopper can come in. Take out the two
SAM sites on the peninsula, then run upwards into the base compound. Kill
the soldiers who are in your way. While you're in the base compound,
demolish the airfields and shoot any barrels you find. When all four SAM
sites are gone, the chopper will pick Tanya up.<P>
     You'll get some reinforcements at the top of the map. You want to use
your engineers to capture the construction yard, weapons factory, and
barracks. Remember that engineers can only capture buildings that are down
to 25 percent health. Once you have a refinery going, crank out some tanks.
Wait until you've built up enough tanks to deal with the enemy's
reinforcements before you attack the enemy ore truck, but don't wait too
long.<P>
     Construct Yak aircraft to take out enemy base defenses from a safe
distance. Allowed to pass unmolested, your tanks will wreck havoc upon the
enemy. Kill everyone and everything. The mission won't end if you let
anyone live.
<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT>
<hr size="0"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000088">
<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="4">Allied Mission 6</font></td></table>
Deploy your MCV where it lands. Get a power plant and barracks up straight
away, followed by a refinery. The enemy will send troops and tanks from the
south. Your only anti-tank weapons at this time are your rocket infantry.
Build a pillbox to act as sponge for enemy fire while your rifle and rocket
units work on the enemy units themselves. Your rocket units will also
handle any enemy aircraft that try to strafe your base.<P>
     Crank out some medium tanks and attack the base in the south. Capture
the barracks with an engineer, and infiltrate the radar dome with a spy.
Now you can see what the enemy is doing. Build a naval yard by the barracks
you captured.<P>
     Block your coastline with tanks to prevent the enemy from landing
troops on your island. Get a spy into the enemy subpen, and get another one
into one of the tech centers. It's easiest if you land them on the craggy
piece of land that juts out before their Tesla coil.<P>
     The next stage of the mission is destroying all enemy units and
buildings. Land 30 medium tanks in the north and slowly work your way down,
destroying all the enemy units. The computer will sell all the buildings at
the last moment, and a horde of tanks and V2 launchers will erupt from the
south.
<BR><FONT SIZE="1"><A HREF="main.htm">Go Back Home</A></FONT>
<hr size="0"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000088">
<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="4">Allied Mission 7</font></td></table>
A combat situation arises immediately. Kill those troopers with your jeep
and tanks. Deploy the MCV, and set up your base. Scout the ore fields to
the east and south with the jeep. Build a pillbox to help kill enemy
troopers. Build another refinery. Make some medium tanks.
     Build rocket infantry to combat enemy airpower. Put a permanent AA gun
in the north of your base. Also put rocket infantry where the ore truck
travels so you can shoot down marauding MiGs.<P>
     Your first objective is to capture the radar dome in the south. A
handful of tanks and an engineer will do it. You can sell the radar dome
after it's been captured.<P>
     The key to finishing the second objective is to destroy the enemy ore
trucks and starve your opponent of cash. The only way to do this is to use
your minelayers to lay thick fields of mines. Once the ore trucks are gone,
you can mass as big a force as you want to destroy the enemy subpens.

Move the two destroyers by your power stations. Train five rocket infantry.
You need to get your MCV into the base where your construction yard will be
better protected, and where you can put your mine layers to good use.
Clear the pass of enemy tanks using focused fire, and move all your
remaining vehicles into the base.<P>
     Plop the construction yard down somewhere inside. Replace the
destroyed advanced power plant. Stick an AA Gun in a corner. Lay solid
minefields on the road outside your northern entrance and in the pass that
faces your easternmost entrance. Construct a camouflaged pillbox next to
one of the northern turrets.<P>
     Build several light tanks, and line the open areas of coastline with
them to block the enemy from landing ground forces. Keep those minelayers
busy replacing detonated mines!

Build the base by the ore deposit to the east. Build fifteen rocket
infantry, and place them in groups of five by the north shore. Build light
tanks, and block the beaches the enemy uses for its invasion attempts.
     Put a spy and an APC into a transport, and carry the them to the top-
right corner of the screen. Land the spy on the beach, and move him across
the bridge, into the enemy base. Once there, inter the headquarters
building, and free the defector, Kosygin.<P>
     A bunch of dogs will appear. Keep Kosygin north of the headquarters
building for now, and wait for all the dogs to "settle". Land the APC, and
command it to run over the dog that parked itself by the top Tesla coil.
With the dog gone, Kosygin can safely pass by the buildings, run over the
bridge, and get to the transport. Your mission ends once you transport him
back to your base.

Deploy the MCV in the protected area to the east. Scout with your light
tanks and run away from superior forces. The enemy armor is too strong for
you to defeat, so don't plan on too many tank battles. Build a tech center
to see where everything is. Observe the enemy ore trucks, and mine what ore
deposits you can. If the ore trucks are gathering ore from a field behind
enemy lines, build five helipads and go after those ore trucks. It will
take two sorties to destroy each truck.<P>
     Without ore trucks, the enemy will leave you be. Concentrate on
gathering ore and building a massive horde of medium tanks. Pick off what
units you can from the air. The enemy infantry is only an annoyance, and
annoyances are quickly cleared with a couple pillboxes. Build rocket
infantry for air defense, and place two AA guns in the northern part of
your base.<P>
     Focus your fire on the nearby Tesla coils before attacking the tanks.
When you've destroyed a large portion of the base, Stalin will launch the
missiles. Run a group of engineers up to the control center in an APC and
capture it.

You are deep inside the control center, the clock is ticking, and you have
very limited resources. Move your units south until you hit the mammoth
tanks. Send your spy south towards the "exit", and Tanya will appear. With
Tanya as your point, explore the passages. <P>
     Take Tanya and an engineer north and east. Kill the soldiers, disable
the first control center. Go west, and do the same to the second control
center. Head north until you see the flame turret. Heal Tanya to full
health, then set a demolition charge on the flame turret. Heal Tanya again,
afterwards.<P>
     North of the flame turret is the third control center. Disable it with
an engineer, and head all the way east and north, and disable the final
control center.

At the start you'll have two MCVs. Deploy both of them. Get your base up
and running, and build two refineries early on. Explore with one of your
light tanks. There's a mammoth tank patrol to the east and north Make note
of their resting locations, and mine them. Get a tech center up to see
where the enemy ore truck is. Build six helipads and destroy the ore truck.
Use rocket infantry as anti-aircraft batteries.<P>
     Assault the base with a task force of medium tanks. Don't destroy the
subpen; infiltrate it with a spy since we need a sonar pulse. Capture the
construction yard and weapons factory. The enemy base on the other side of
the river will start construction. Destroy their ore trucks with your
helicopters.<P>
     Make some V2 rocket launchers to take out the Tesla coils on the
island. Break a whole in the concrete wall on the coastal side of the base,
and send your tanks through to the northern section of your land mass and
destroy the power stations. Create a naval yard and make a transport. If
submarines attack the naval yard, destroy them with V2 rocket launchers and
helicopters. Land V2 rocket launchers on the Tesla coil island and get rid
of the SAM sites.<P>
     Fire the sonar pulse. The V2 rocket launcher should take out some of
the submarines nearby. To get the others, use your transport as a decoy to
make the subs surface, and blast them from the sky with helicopters.
     Friendly naval power will arrive and if you've destroyed all the subs,
your mission will be accomplished.

<hr size="0"><table width="100%" bgcolor="#000088">
<td><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size="4">Allied Mission 12</font></td></table>
Deploy the MCV near where you land. Stick a camo pillbox as far to the
north-east of your base as you can. Use the jeep to scout to the east. When
you see the mammoth tank, turn around. Scout east, and north, shooting any
dogs you come across. Retreat at the first sign of enemy armor.<P>
     A mammoth tank will move towards your base, followed by a civilian.
Shoot the civilian before it drops a signal flare. The mammoth tank will go
invulnerable, and try to attack your ore trucks. Drive the trucks around in
circles until the invulnerability wears off, and then kill the mammoth with
your medium and light tanks.<P>
     Expand your base, and put camo pillboxes in your extreme corners. Push
the spy north through the center, and follow the river crossing east past
the Tesla coil into the enemy base. Follow the coastline and infiltrate the
enemy subpen.<P>
     When your GPS satellite goes up, you'll see two bases, one on the
left, and one on the right. The base on the right has an ore truck that is
using a northern ore deposit. Send six Longbow helicopters after the ore
truck and destroy it.<P>
     Mine the road that leads through the village. The enemy will almost
always use roads, and if you can kill those mammoth tanks with mines before
it has a chance to go invulnerable, more power to you.<P>
     Now, the base on the left side will start ore refining. To avoid the
SAM fire when attacking the trucks, send your helicopters to a place near
the west edge of the map before commanding them to attack. With those ore
trucks out of action, the computer will stop building things, and you can
finish the mission by sniping at your targets with helicopters to weaken
their base defenses so you can roll in your engineer-laden APCs and tanks.

Your top units are Group A, and your bottom units are Group B. Move Group A
engineers to the control panel to destroy a flame turret. Move Group B to
the east, and kill everyone there. Move Group B further east, and use the
control panel to destroy the northern turret.<P>
     Move Group A east past the tanks. If you have trouble killing the
enemy infantry, remember to group your riflemen in groups of five. Follow
the riflemen with the medic, and heal the soldiers while they fight. Let
the enemy come to you; riflemen can't shoot on the move. Go north through
the passageway; the first generator is here. Head back out and east, where
there's another turret control panel to disable.<P>
     Backtrack a bit with Group B, and advance south. There's a grenadier
at the generator controls. Rush him with rifle infantry. When your engineer
sets a charge on the generator, you'll get some more rifle infantry as
reinforcements. Move Group B east until you hit another room with a
generator. Set a charge on this one, and continue east until you reach big
room with flame turrets and several control panels.<P>
     The center control panel takes out the north-west turret. The north-
west panel takes out the center turret. With good timing, you can send a
single engineer to do both of these without getting hurt. The south-west
panel is a generator, but you can't get to it safely just yet. Instead,
move Group B up to Group A, and make a new team consisting of five rifle
infantry, two doctors, and one engineer.<P>
     Move the team east to another generator, then south and west. You'll
be back at the central hub. Kill all the infantry now that you have two
medics helping out with the healing. Head south. A very small computer is
in the west wall. Place an engineer here to activate the turret control.
Head west from the V2 room, and kill the flame thrower and the dog by
shooting the barrels. Two control panels on the wall disable turrets, and
the one in the room to the west itself is another generator.<P>
     There are two generators left in the central hub. Disable both of
them. If the flame turrets are still up, don't worry. The engineers will
get to the control panels before dying. Take the lower right passage. Move
all your units inside. Move your spy into the room with all the units.
Something strange will happen! All the bad guys will ignore your men and
run out of the room! Move your engineers east, and reprogram the last
generator computer.

Move Tanya and the thieves down to protect them from the barrel explosion,
then move them up to protect them from the other barrel explosion. Shoot
all the infantry while you move west. When you hit the coast, move north
into the base. Destroy the small power stations. Shoot at the delivery van
with Tanya's pistol. If it runs away, go back south the way you came and
cut it off and the river crossing. Shoot at it some more, and it will
explode, revealing a crate full of money. <P>
     Go back up, and destroy the large power plants. Move the thieves into
the ore silos and steal their money. Reinforcements will arrive. Deploy the
MCV where you see the signal flare.<P>
     Like in the previous missions, the Soviets will send invulnerable
mammoth tanks at you. These tanks travel in a predictable path to get to
your base, so by mining their paths, you'll pre-empt this particular
threat. Rocket infantry will protect you from planes. Back them up with
some AA guns around your power stations. Find the enemy ore truck once the
GPS is launched. Build six helicopter pads, and destroy the ore truck.
Without the ore truck, the enemy will stop sending units at you.
     When the ore truck of the southern base is destroyed, the eastern base
will start sending out its trucks. Their ore fields have no SAM cover, so
destroying them shouldn't be a problem.<P>
     Construct a naval yard and build a cruiser. To extend your base to the
water, build a chain of barracks building until you hit the coast. Put up
some anti-air defenses by the naval yard. The chronosphere can move units
from one place to another for a limited amount of time. Chronoshift the
cruiser into the lake by the southern base, and tear their buildings to
shreds. If the cruiser guns overshoot, force attack on a game square that
is slightly above the building to correct it.<P>
     Repeat until they give up and sell all the buildings. Next,
chronoshift the cruiser into the small lake in the bottom left corner and
shell the airstrips and power stations to the north.<P>
     Send your helicopters on SAM site busting missions. You'll lose a
helicopter in the process, but that's what money is for. With the SAM sites
gone, you can destroy the power stations at your leisure to silence the
Tesla coils, then your tank groups in for the kill.
